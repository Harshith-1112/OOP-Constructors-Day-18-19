Constructors:

this()

Usage:
this() is used to call another constructor within the same class.

Placement:
It must be first statement in the constructor if used. It allows constructor to involve another constructor to avoid code duplication and manage different initialization scenarios within the same class.

Example:
Useful when a class has multiple constructors with varying parameters, allowing them to call each other to ensure consistent initialization logic.

this keyword:
In java this is a reference variable that refers to the current object instance, it can be used in several contexts.

1.To refer to instance variables when there is ambiguity between instance variables and local variables or method parameters this is used to refer current instance variable.
2. To involve current class method :
 
Constructor Chaining

You can use this() to call another constructor from within a constructor. And another constructor can call another level constructor within same class this is nothing but constructor chaining.




Day-19 Constructor chaing with this keyword
------------------------------------------------
Problem Statement-1)
At TechNova Pvt. Ltd., HR wants to manage employee records and calculate bonuses based on salary and experience.
 Each employee has the following details:
empId
name
salary
experience (in years)


The company gives bonuses as follows:
If experience < 3 years → 5% of salary
If experience between 3 and 7 → 10% of salary
If experience > 7 → 15% of salary


Use constructor chaining to initialize employee details and the this keyword to access instance variables and methods within the class.
Input Format
empId name salary experience

Output Format
Employee Details:
ID: <empId>
Name: <name>
Salary: <salary>
Experience: <experience>
Bonus: <calculated bonus>


Test Case 1
Input:
101 Ravi 50000 2

Output:
Employee Details:
ID: 101
Name: Ravi
Salary: 50000.0
Experience: 2
Bonus: 2500.0

Explanation:
 Experience < 3 → Bonus = 5% of 50000 = 2500.

Test Case 2
Input:
102 Sneha 70000 5

Output:

ID: 102
Name: Sneha
Salary: 70000.0
Experience: 5
Bonus: 7000.0

Explanation:
 Experience between 3 and 7 → Bonus = 10% of 70000 = 7000.

Test Case 3
Input:
103 Arjun 90000 8

Output:
Employee Details:
ID: 103
Name: Arjun
Salary: 90000.0

Question 2): Bank Loan Interest Calculator
Scenario:
At SafeBank Ltd., a system is required to manage customer loan details.
 Each customer has:
loanId
customerName
loanAmount
loanType (Home / Car / Personal)


Each loan type has a different interest rate:
Home Loan → 8%
Car Loan → 9%
Personal Loan → 11%


Use constructor chaining to initialize data and use this keyword to access instance variables and methods.
 The system must calculate the total amount payable = loanAmount + (loanAmount × interestRate / 100).

Input Format
loanId customerName loanAmount loanType
Output Format
Loan Details:
Loan ID: <loanId>
Customer Name: <customerName>
Loan Amount: <loanAmount>
Loan Type: <loanType>
Total Payable: <calculated amount>


Test Case 1
Input:
201 Ramesh 200000 Home
Output:
Loan Details:
Loan ID: 201
Customer Name: Ramesh
Loan Amount: 200000.0
Loan Type: Home
Total Payable: 216000.0
Explanation:
 Home Loan → 8% interest → 200000 + 8% = 216000

Test Case 2
