Garbage Collection:

The ways to an object eligible for GC.

nullifying the reference variable.
Reassign the reference variable.
Objects are created inside method.
island isolation.


Finalize:

What is the role of Finalize Method?

The finalize() method is a special method provided by the object class in java. Which can over ridden to perform clean up operations before an object is Garbage Collected.




Constructor:

Object creation is not enough compulsory we should perform initialization then only the object is in a position to provide response properly.

when ever we are creating an object some piece of code will be executed automatically to perform initialization of an object this piece of code is nothing but Constructor.

Hence the main Objective of Constructor is to perform initialization of an object.



Rules to write Constructors:

1.Name of the constructor and name of the class must be same.
2. Return type concept is not applicable for constructor even void also by mistake if we are declaring the return type for the constructor we wont get any compile time and runtime error compiler simply treats it as a method.
3. The only applicable modifiers to declare constructors are public, private, protected and default.

Types of Constructors:

There are 3 types of constructors.

Default constructor:

For Every class in java including abstract classes also constructor concept is applicable.

If we are not writing at least one constructor then compiler will generate default constructor.

If we are writing at least one constructor then complier won't generate any default constructor. Hence every class contains either compiler generated constructor or programmer written constructor but not both simultaneously.

Syntax:

public className(){
}

Parameterized constructor:

a parameterized constructor in java is a constructor that allow you to initialize the Objects of a class with specific values at a time of Object creation.

unlike the default constructor, which takes no arguments, a parameterized constructor accept one or more parameters.

Syntax:

public className(parameter-list){

}

Copy Constructor:

A copy constructor in java is a special type of constructor that initializes a new object as a copy of an existing object of the same class.

It accepts on object of the same class as parameter and initializes the new object state with values from existing object.

Syntax:

modifier className(classObject){
}


Question:
In the bustling School of Learnville, administrator Clara manages student records using a Student class.
She needs a parameterized constructor to initialize a student's roll number and name when a new student is enrolled with specific details.
This ensures that each student object is created with valid data, avoiding manual setting of fields after creation.
Your task is to write a Java program that defines a Student class with a parameterized constructor accepting a roll number (integer) and name (string).
Include a method to display the student's details and a main method to create and print a student object based on input values,

Testcase-1
Input:
101
Amit

Output:
Roll Number: 101
Name: Amit



OOP Day-2 Constructors Day-18
=================================

Question-1) 
create a Java program using a class called Student with the following specifications:

Class Requirements:
Instance Variables:

String name

int rollNumber

int[] marks (for 3 subjects)

Constructors:

Default Constructor:

Set name to "Unknown"

Roll number to 0

Marks to {0, 0, 0}

Parameterized Constructor:

Accept name, roll number, and marks for 3 subjects

Instance Methods:

void displayDetails()
→ Print name, roll number, and all marks

int calculateTotal()
→ Return the total of all 3 marks

double calculateAverage()
→ Return the average of the marks

 In the main() method (inside another class named StudentDemo), do the following:
Create one object using the default constructor

Create another object using the parameterized constructor

Call displayDetails(), calculateTotal(), and calculateAverage() for both objects complete this task based on the fallowing conditions
